## Learning Objectives

* Write their own functions which solidify what we've been telling them in prior readme's where a function should do one thing and one thing well.
* Call on functions they've written themselves to see the output.


## Instructions

* Open up the playground file included with this repo and answer the listed questions (which you will find in the playground file) in order. 
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* The following two screenshots are included to assist you in case the file doesn't open right to the main.swift file (which it should by default).
* Make sure you're working in the main.swift file (which you can view by pressing command + 0):
